<div class="accordion"> Symbolic Integration in Magma </div>
<div class="panel">
    <p> Source code: <a href="https://github.com/mitchellholt/magma-integration">[GitHub repository] </a></p>
    <p>
        Magma does not have a symbolic computation library! This project is a
        partial implementation of the Risch integration procedure that aims to
        integrate nicely with the existing differential algebra functionality of
        Magma. You'll notice that I only have implementations for the
        integration of rational and logarithmic functions, and my logarithmic
        integration code unfortunately does not pass my tests.

<div class="accordion"> <em> VERY FAST </em> FFT Polynomial Multipliation </div>
<div class="panel">
    <p> Source code: <a href="https://github.com/mitchellholt/COSC3500-project/tree/main/Parallel">[GitHub repository] </a></p>
    <p>
        This was a really fun project I did for my High Performance Computing
        class (COSC3500) at the University of Queensland! I spent way too long
        writing some <em>very fast</em> C code for the multiplication of
        polynomials whose coefficients come from a specific finite field. The
        final result is that I am more than 5 times faster than Maple! (with the
        caveat that Maple, unlike me, has to interpret source code and decide
        which kernel code to execute at runtime)
