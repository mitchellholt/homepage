        A talk I gave in January 2024 after a project where I learned about the
        Risch algorithm for symbolic integration, and wrote a
        <a href="https://github.com/mitchellholt/magma-integration">
        partial implementation </a> in the Magma computer algebra system! In
        this talk, we cover the very basics of the integration of rational
        functions, and I show off a (very preliminary version of) my integration
        library!

        This was a really fun talk I gave to the <a href="https://uqmss.org/">
        UQ Mathematics Student Society </a> in early 2024. I wish there was a
        recording because this was a great time, and I got to answer some really
        interesting and thoughtful questions!

<div class="accordion"> What Even is a Computer Algebra? </div>
<div class="panel">
    <p> Recording: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/CTj36qzWcPI?si=j-ZYv3EZCvivCtdZ"> [YouTube video] </a>
    <p> Slides: <a href="files/ComputerAlgebraIntro-UQCS.pdf" download> [pdf] </a> </p>
    <p>
        This is a talk I gave to the <a href="https://uqcs.org/">
        UQ Computing Society, </a> aiming to introduce students with a
        background in programming to doing <em>exact</em> mathematical
        computation, and the broader field of computer algebra. I found out
        later that one of the students who attended the talk went away and
        spoke to a professor at UQ about doing an honours project in computer
        algebra - and that they were inspired to do so by my talk!

        Please note that it was very cool at the time to slap AI generated
        images of bears everywhere. I promise I'm not crazy.
